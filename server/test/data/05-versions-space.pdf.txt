Proposal for Enhancing AI/ML and Cybersecurity Education in the MIST CSE Program
1Early Integration of AI/ML/Cybersecurity in Cur-
riculum
•Current  Concern:  AI/ML/Cybersecurity  domains  are  introduced  late  (end  of
Level 4), limiting deep learning and real-world application.
•Proposed Change:  Beginning these subjects fromLevel 3, enabling:
–In-depth project-based learning
–Better preparation for internships and jobs
–Integration of AI into final-year projects
2    .  Launch of AI and Cybersecurity Research Clubs
•Establishstudent-led research groupsunder faculty supervision.
•Hostseminars, hackathons, and inter-university challenges.
•Facilitate participation ininternational AI/Cybersecurity competitions(e.g.,
DEFCON, Kaggle, AI Blitz).
3Affordable or no barrier Access to Cyberrange
•Problem:  Lack of access to cyber range and costly cybersecurity courses.
•Recommendations:
–Implement ascholarship or subsidy modelbased on merit and interest for
the cyberrange courses conducted in mist, so students can easily join them
–Increasing the courses and activities in the cyberrange
–Continue the initiative planned byBrig Gen Touhid Sirto make cyberse-
curity education accessible, affordable and keeping no fees for students for the
cyberrange courses

4Extracurricular Courses and Workshops
•If  immediate  curriculum  changes  are  impractical,  initiate  extracurricularwork-
shops, bootcamps, and certifications.
•Collaborate  withlocal  AI  startups  and  research  labs(e.g.,  BRAC  AI  Lab,
BJIT, Datasoft).
•Utilizeopen-source platformslike Google Colab, FastAI, and HuggingFace for
practical learning.
